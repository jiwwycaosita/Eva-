## Continuity Rules

### 1. Visual Continuity
- **Lighting Consistency**: Maintain consistent lighting direction, quality, and color temperature across related scenes
- **Color Grading**: Keep color palette and grading consistent within sequences
- **Weather/Atmosphere**: Ensure environmental conditions remain logical (don't jump from rain to sunshine)

### 2. Temporal Continuity
- **Time Progression**: Maintain logical time flow (dawn → day → dusk → night)
- **Action Flow**: Ensure movements start where previous clip ended
- **Character State**: Keep character positions, clothing, and props consistent

### 3. Spatial Continuity
- **Geography**: Maintain spatial relationships between locations
- **Camera Position**: Follow the 180-degree rule for conversation scenes
- **Scale**: Keep relative sizes of objects consistent

### 4. Motion Continuity
- **Speed**: Maintain consistent motion speed across cuts
- **Direction**: Keep movement direction logical (screen direction)
- **Momentum**: Ensure physical actions follow natural physics

### 5. Audio-Visual Sync (Consideration)
- **Lip Sync**: For character dialogue (if applicable)
- **Action Sounds**: Consider how actions would sound for future audio design
- **Ambient Sound**: Think about environmental audio when describing atmosphere

## Best Practices

### DO:
✅ Be specific and detailed in descriptions
✅ Use vivid, descriptive language
✅ Specify camera movements and angles
✅ Include lighting and mood descriptors
✅ Reference continuity with previous/next scenes
✅ Consider the emotional impact you want to create
✅ Use industry-standard terminology
✅ Include technical specifications when relevant
✅ Think about the story being told

### DON'T:
❌ Be vague or ambiguous
❌ Overload with contradictory instructions
❌ Ignore lighting and atmosphere
❌ Forget about camera perspective
❌ Mix incompatible visual styles within sequences
❌ Neglect continuity between shots
❌ Use overly complex or confusing language
❌ Forget to specify important technical details

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Emotion and Atmosphere
Build mood through detailed environmental and lighting descriptions:
```
"Golden hour sunlight filtering through dust particles, creating a dreamy, nostalgic atmosphere with warm amber tones and soft shadows"
```

### 2. Dynamic Camera Work
Create energy through movement descriptions:
```
"Dynamic low-angle tracking shot racing forward, camera tilting up to reveal the subject, creating a sense of power and momentum"
```

### 3. Cinematic Transitions
Plan for scene transitions:
```
"Scene ends with slow zoom into character's eye, suggesting transition to flashback/dream sequence"
```

### 4. Layered Action
Create depth with multiple action layers:
```
"Foreground: Steam rising from coffee cup. Mid-ground: Character typing on laptop, slight head movements. Background: Pedestrians passing by window, out of focus."
```

### 5. Symbolic Visual Elements
Include meaningful details:
```
"Wilting flower in vase on the table, symbolizing the passage of time and fading relationship"
```
