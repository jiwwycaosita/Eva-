---

### SCÈNE 6 : Recherche Inutile - Battues dans la Neige

#### PLAN 6.1 : Battues - Plan d'ensemble (20 secondes)

**PROMPT DÉTAILLÉ :**
```
Wide exterior shot of a small Quebec village (Saint-Cécile-de-Milton) in daytime, overcast winter sky. Multiple people (10-15 villagers) spread across a snowy field and forest edge, conducting a search. They wear winter coats (various dark colors - black, navy, brown), moving slowly through deep snow, calling out, looking down. Some hold walking sticks, some with flashlights even in daylight. In foreground right: ANABELLE (32, dark hair, red winter coat standing out), exhausted, face pale with dark circles, moving frantically while others move methodically. She calls "EVA! EVA!" repeatedly, voice hoarse. In background: village houses, church steeple, bare trees. Snow falling lightly. Color palette: desaturated blues and greys, white snow, Anabelle's red coat only bright spot. Drone shot starting high, slowly descending and pushing forward toward Anabelle. Sense of futility - vast white landscape, tiny figures. 2.35:1 ratio, 4K, 24fps. Photorealistic. Style: "Fargo" winter searches, "Prisoners" desperate hunt. Cold, bleak atmosphere.
```

**PARAMÈTRES :**
- Mouvement : Crane down + push in (10 secondes)
- Vitesse : Lente, contemplative
- Focus : Deep (tout net)

**AMBIANCE SONORE :**
- Vent constant (médium)
- Pas dans la neige (multiple personnes)
- Voix d'Anabelle amplifiée : "EVA! EVA!"

- Musique : Cordes graves, drone inquiétant

---

#### PLAN 6.2 : Poste de Police - Interrogatoire (30 secondes)

**PROMPT DÉTAILLÉ :**
```
Interior shot of a small rural police station office. Fluorescent lighting (harsh, cold white, 5000K), creating unflattering shadows. Wooden desk with papers, computer (old model), coffee cups. Behind desk: SERGENT BEAULIEU (48, Quebec accent, stern face, grey-brown hair, mustache, wearing police uniform - dark blue with badge), sitting, looking skeptical. Across from him: ANABELLE (disheveled, red-rimmed eyes from crying, wearing same grey sweater from days without sleep, trembling slightly) and SHAWN (35, brown hair, unshaven, flannel shirt, jeans, looking defeated and angry). Camera positioned at Beaulieu's shoulder (over-shoulder shot), showing the couple's desperate faces. Beaulieu speaks: "Madame Tremblay, on fait tout ce qu'on peut. Mais avec la tempête..." (skeptical tone, shrug). Anabelle leans forward intensely: "Elle a 8 ans. Elle ne peut pas être loin." (voice breaking). Shawn interjects, tense: "Vous avez vérifié le fossé? Les tuyaux?" Beaulieu's face hardens slightly: "On a regardé. Rien." (dismissive). Hold on his face - subtle suggestion he's hiding something or doesn't care enough. Medium shot, static camera then slow push-in on Beaulieu's cold eyes. 2.35:1 ratio, 4K. Photorealistic. Style: "Zodiac" police procedural coldness, "Gone Girl" interrogation tension. Institutional indifference.
```

**MICRO-EXPRESSIONS CRITIQUES :**
- Beaulieu : Froncement léger quand Shawn mentionne les tuyaux (il sait quelque chose?)
- Anabelle : Désespoir absolu, mains tremblantes
- Shawn : Colère contenue, poings serrés

**SON :**
- Bourdonnement fluorescent (agaçant, sous-jacent)
- Dialogue (accent québécois authentique)
- Silence pesant entre les répliques
- Chaise qui grince quand Anabelle se penche

---

### SCÈNE 7 : Jugement Muet - L'Épicerie

#### PLAN 7.1 : Entrée dans l'épicerie (25 secondes)

**PROMPT DÉTAILLÉ :**
```
Interior tracking shot following ANABELLE from behind as she pushes open the door of a small rural Quebec general store (épicerie). Bell jingles above door. Camera follows her in (steadicam, smooth). Interior: small, cluttered, fluorescent lights, wooden shelves with canned goods, freezer humming in background, linoleum floor. 4-5 LOCAL VILLAGERS inside - older people (60s-70s), wearing winter clothes, shopping or talking. As Anabelle enters, ALL CONVERSATIONS STOP. Heads turn toward her in unison (eerie synchronization). Villagers' faces: mixture of pity, judgment, suspicion. One older woman whispers to another (audible): "C'est elle..." Another: "Pauvre petite..." A third, more accusatory: "On dit qu'elle était souvent seule..." Camera circles around Anabelle (360° rotation, slow), showing her face registering their stares - she hears everything. Her expression: humiliation, anger, sadness. She's the outsider, the accused. At counter: MARIE-CLAIRE (42, shopkeeper, knitting, looks up with false sympathy). Anabelle grabs bread mechanically, approaches counter. Oppressive atmosphere. 2.35:1 ratio, 4K. Style: "Rosemary's Baby" paranoia, "The Wicker Man" hostile community. Sound perspective follows Anabelle - whispers amplified, her breathing loud.
```

**DÉTAILS PERSONNAGES :**
- Villageois : Visages québécois authentiques, vêtements modestes
- Expressions : Jugement silencieux, regards fixes
- Marie-Claire : Fausse gentillesse, tricote (jamais arrête)

**SON :**
- Cloche de porte (tintement aigu)
- Silence soudain (coupure brutale des conversations)
- Chuchotements amplifiés (effet psychologique)
- Respiration d'Anabelle (anxiété)
- Aiguilles à tricoter (clic-clic régulier, irritant)

---

### SCÈNE 8 : Le Retour du Chat Noir

#### PLAN 8.1 : Chat à la porte (15 secondes)

**PROMPT DÉTAILLÉ :**
```
Interior night shot. ANABELLE sits alone on a worn couch in dim living room, lit only by one lamp (warm yellow, low wattage). She holds a wine glass (nearly empty), staring at nothing. House is silent except for wind outside. SUDDENLY: scratching sound at front door (same sound from when Eva left). Anabelle's head snaps toward the door, face frozen. She sets down wine glass (hand shaking - glass rattles on table), stands slowly. Camera stays low, follows her feet walking toward door (building tension). She reaches door, hesitates (hand hovering over doorknob), then opens it. REVEAL: BLACK CAT sitting perfectly still on snowy doorstep, staring up at her with reflective yellow-green eyes. Snowflakes land on its black fur. It doesn't move, just stares. Anabelle's POV: close-up of cat's face, unblinking. She whispers: "Toi..." (recognition, fear, confusion). She blinks - when eyes reopen, cat is still there (confirming it's real, not hallucination... or is it?). She reaches out slowly. Cat tilts head, then turns and walks away into darkness. Door frame creates a rectangle of warm interior light against black snowy night. Anabelle stands silhouetted, watching it disappear. Holds for 3 seconds, then she closes door slowly. 2.35:1 ratio, 4K. Photorealistic. Style: "The Shining" supernatural ambiguity, "Hereditary" unsettling animal presence. Blue-black night, warm interior contrast.
```

**SYMBOLISME :**
- Chat = Retour du trauma, culpabilité personnifiée
- Même grattement = Boucle temporelle, répétition
- Apparition/disparition = Réalité incertaine

**SON :**
- Grattement (exactement comme Scène 3)
- Silence de la maison (amplification du grattement)
- Respiration d'Anabelle (peur)
- Verre qui vibre sur la table
- Vent dehors (whoosh quand porte s'ouvre)
- Miaulement lointain quand chat part

---

#### PLAN 8.2 : Anabelle et Shawn - Lit (12 secondes)

**PROMPT DÉTAILLÉ :**
```
Interior bedroom, night. Dark blue moonlight through window. Medium shot of a double bed. SHAWN (35, unshaven, t-shirt) lies on his side, back to camera/Anabelle, facing wall. ANABELLE enters frame right, gets into bed carefully (trying not to disturb him). She lies on her back, staring at ceiling. Long pause (5 seconds of silence). She speaks quietly: "Tu l'as vu, toi, le chat?" Shawn doesn't move. Pause. "Quel chat?" (flat, dismissive, not even turning). "Le chat noir. Dehors." Pause. "Non." (final, conversation over). Anabelle continues staring at ceiling. Slow push-in on her face - eyes wide open, not blinking, isolated even in bed with her husband. Hold. 2.35:1 ratio, 4K. Static camera then slow zoom. Photorealistic. Style: "Marriage Story" marital distance, "Revolutionary Road" silent alienation. Cold color grading, emphasis on separation within same frame.
```

**SOUS-TEXTE :**
- Shawn ne la croit pas (ou refuse de croire)
- Distance physique = distance émotionnelle
- Anabelle seule avec ses visions

**SON :**
- Silence presque total
- Respiration de deux personnes (désynchronisée)
- Draps qui froissent
- Voix chuchotées
- Ronronnement très faint en fond (suggéré, ambigu)

---

### SCÈNE 9 : Tensions - La Dispute

#### PLAN 9.1 : Dispute dans la cuisine (40 secondes)

**PROMPT DÉTAILLÉ :**
```
Interior day, kitchen (same location as Scene 1). Harsh winter daylight through window (overcast, flat light). ANABELLE and SHAWN face each other across kitchen table (battleground). Camera positioned between them (shot-reverse-shot setup but presented as one continuous argument, camera swiveling). SHAWN (angry, pointing finger): "Tu l'as laissée sortir seule!" Face red, vein visible on forehead. ANABELLE (defensive, tears starting): "Je travaillais! Tu n'étais jamais là!" Voice rising. SHAWN: "Parce que je dois travailler! Pour payer cette maison!" Throws hands up. Camera tight on faces - extreme close-ups capturing pain, anger, blame. Both are grieving but attacking each other. Anabelle's face crumples, Shawn's hardens. Silence (5 seconds) - they both realize they've gone too far. Shawn, quieter but cold: "Je vais dormir au motel. J'en peux plus." Grabs jacket from chair, walks out frame left. Sound of front door slamming (off-screen). Anabelle stands alone in kitchen, shaking. Camera pulls back slowly to wide shot showing her small and alone in the empty kitchen. Sun goes behind clouds - room darkens. 2.35:1 ratio, 4K. Handheld (shaky during argument), then stabilizes to static (emptiness after). Photorealistic. Style: "Kramer vs Kramer" marital breakdown, "Blue Valentine" relationship destruction. Raw, painful, realistic acting.
```

**ÉMOTIONS COMPLEXES :**
- Douleur déguisée en colère
- Culpabilité projetée
- Amour sous la haine
- Rupture inévitable

**SON :**
- Voix qui montent en volume
- Chaise qui racle
- Porte qui claque (violence du son)
- Silence après départ
- Anabelle qui pleure (sanglots étouffés)

## 🎬 ACTE III - DESCENTE LENTE (30-45 minutes)

---

### SCÈNE 10 : Le Doute Intérieur - Hallucinations

#### PLAN 10.1 : Anabelle voit Eva dans le couloir (18 secondes)

**PROMPT DÉTAILLÉ :**
```
Interior hallway, dim lighting (late afternoon, one lamp). ANABELLE walks down narrow hallway of house carrying folded laundry. Camera follows behind her (tracking shot, steady). She passes a doorway (Eva's old bedroom). She stops. Looks into room. CAMERA BECOMES HER POV: Empty room, bed made, no one there. Blink (screen goes black 0.2 seconds). Eyes reopen: EVA (8, blonde, wearing her red coat) stands in the room facing the window, back to camera/Anabelle. Anabelle gasps (audible inhale). "Eva?" (whispered, hopeful). The figure doesn't move. Anabelle steps into room, reaching out. Camera switches to objective third-person: we see Anabelle reaching toward empty space - no one there. Back to her POV: Eva turns slowly - but her face is blurred, features indistinct (nightmare logic). She opens mouth as if to speak but no sound. Blink again (longer, 0.5 seconds). Eyes open: room is empty. Anabelle standing alone, hand still outstretched. She lowers hand slowly, expression devastated. Was it real? Camera zooms slowly on her confused, terrified face. 2.35:1 ratio, 4K. Subtle visual distortion on hallucination (slight chromatic aberration, dreamlike soft focus). Photorealistic but surreal. Style: "Black Swan" hallucinations, "Repulsion" losing grip on reality, "The Machinist" sleep deprivation visions.
```

**TECHNIQUE VISUELLE :**
- Hallucination : Légèrement désaturée, flou artistique
- Réalité : Nette, couleurs normales
- Transition : Clignement des yeux (cut noir)

**SON :**
- Silence inquiétant
- Respiration d'Anabelle (amplifiée)
- Voix d'Eva (écho, déformée) : "Maman..."
- Coupure brutale du son (retour réalité)

---

#### PLAN 10.2 : Montage de décrépitude (30 secondes)

**PROMPT POUR MONTAGE RAPIDE :**
```
Quick montage (6-8 shots, 3-5 seconds each) showing ANABELLE's mental deterioration over days/weeks. SHOT 1: Close-up, she stares at herself in bathroom mirror, doesn't recognize herself (touches face). SHOT 2: Kitchen at night, she sits in dark, wine bottle empty, lights off. SHOT 3: She wanders through house at 3am (visible on clock), calling "Eva?" to empty rooms. SHOT 4: Close-up of pills spilling from prescription bottle into her hand (too many). SHOT 5: She stands at Eva's bedroom door, hand on doorknob, can't go in. SHOT 6: Lying in bed, eyes wide open, ceiling fan spinning above (hypnotic, can't sleep). SHOT 7: Looking out window at night, seeing shapes in darkness (paranoia). SHOT 8: Back to mirror - she's visibly thinner, hair unwashed, eyes hollow. Each shot progressively darker color grading, more desaturated. Time passage shown by changing light (day/night cycling fast), accumulating mess in house. Disorienting editing rhythm - cuts on different beats, no pattern. 2.35:1, 4K. Style: "Requiem for a Dream" addiction montage, "Black Swan" psychological breakdown, "Pi" descending into madness. SOUND: Overlapping whispers (Eva's voice), ticking clocks out of sync, heartbeat bass.
```

**PROGRESSION :**
- Jours 1-3 : Essaie de maintenir normalité
- Jours 4-7 : Abandon hygiène/routine
- Semaines 2-3 : Hallucinations fréquentes
- Présent : Au bord de la rupture totale

---

### SCÈNE 11 : Le Ventre - Grossesse

#### PLAN 11.1 : Test de grossesse (20 secondes)

**PROMPT DÉTAILLÉ :**
```
Interior bathroom, harsh fluorescent light. Close-up of ANABELLE's hands holding a pregnancy test stick. She's sitting on closed toilet lid (we see her from waist down initially). Camera slowly tilts up as she looks at the result: POSITIVE (two pink lines visible in extreme close-up insert). Her face: complex reaction - not joy, not horror, just numbness. She's wearing same grey sweater (hasn't changed in days), hair greasy. She looks at her reflection in medicine cabinet mirror - opens cabinet, bottles of pills visible, closes it, her hollow-eyed reflection stares back. She touches her abdomen gently. Whispers: "Pas maintenant..." (not now). Hold on her face. Slow zoom out revealing small, cramped bathroom, she's alone, trapped. 2.35:1, 4K. Photorealistic. Style: "4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days" pregnancy as crisis, "Rosemary's Baby" unwanted pregnancy dread. Clinical lighting emphasizing isolation.
```

**AMBIGUÏTÉ :**
- Est-ce de Shawn? (ils sont distants)
- Timing terrible
- Nouvelle vie quand une est perdue

**SON :**
- Bourdonnement fluorescent
- Respiration tremblante
- Cliquetis du test posé sur lavabo (céramique)
- Silence extérieur (maison vide)

---

#### PLAN 11.2 : Chat sur le ventre (15 secondes)

**PROMPT DÉTAILLÉ :**
```
Interior bedroom, night. Moonlight through window (blue). ANABELLE lies in bed on her back, one hand on her abdomen. Camera overhead shot looking down at her. She's awake, staring up at camera/ceiling. Slowly, from bottom of frame, the BLACK CAT walks into view, up onto the bed, stepping carefully. It walks up her body (POV from above shows it getting closer to camera) and settles on her stomach, circling twice then lying down, purring (we hear it). Anabelle doesn't react with fear - she's too exhausted, or it's become normal, or she's dissociating. She even strokes its head gently with one hand. Close-up of her face: tears run down temples into her hair, but expression is almost peaceful (surrendered to madness?). Close-up of cat: eyes half-closed, purring, but there's something wrong - its presence is too perfect, too timed. Is it comforting or sinister? Ambiguous. Hold this tableau (woman, cat, moonlight, tears) for 5 seconds. Fade to black. 2.35:1, 4K. Photorealistic cat, real animal behavior but uncanny context. Style: "Rosemary's Baby" demonic pregnancy, "Antichrist" nature as malevolent. SOUND: Purring (very loud in mix, almost unsettling volume), her breath synchronizing with purring rhythm (hypnotic).
```

**SYMBOLISME :**
- Chat sur ventre = Possession? Gardien? Culpabilité?
- Purring = Réconfort ou menace?
- Anabelle accepte = Résignation à la folie

---

### SCÈNE 12 : Flash - Le Tunnel (POV Eva)

#### PLAN 12.1 : Flashback dans le tunnel (20 secondes)

**PROMPT FLASHBACK TRAUMATIQUE :**
```
FLASHBACK SEQUENCE (visual cue: oversaturated white flash before entering). POV from EVA's perspective inside dark tunnel (same tunnel from Scene 4). Extreme close-up, shaky (child's panicked movement). Near-total darkness, only faint grey light far behind showing tunnel entrance. Child's small hands visible at bottom of frame, scraping on wet concrete, trying to crawl back. Breath visible (white vapor), breathing very fast (hyperventilating). Sound muffled as if underwater. Distant rumbling (snowplow) getting louder. She calls: "Maman! Maman!" (child voice, terrified, echoing). She looks back toward entrance - the light is shrinking, darkness closing in. She scrambles faster but it's like moving through molasses (dream logic). The entrance becomes a tiny dot, then disappears - complete black. Her scream cuts off (sealed in). Hold on black for 3 seconds. SMASH CUT BACK TO PRESENT: Anabelle jolts awake in bed, gasping, covered in sweat. She's experiencing Eva's last moments in her nightmares/visions. 2.35:1 initially then image distorts at edges (vignetted, tunnel vision). Photorealistic within darkness. Style: "The Lovely Bones" POV of victim, "Enter the Void" first-person death, "Jacob's Ladder" trauma flashbacks. SOUND DESIGN CRITICAL: child's panicked breathing, echo distortion, rumble building to overwhelming bass, scream that cuts to silence, then Anabelle's gasp (return to present).
```

**EFFET PSYCHOLOGIQUE :**
- Anabelle revit les derniers moments d'Eva
- Empathie terrible ou hallucination?
- Trauma transmis

---

### SCÈNE 13 : Lettre dans le Vent - DÉCOUVERTE DU CORPS

#### PLAN 13.1 : Printemps - Neige a fondu (10 secondes)

**PROMPT TRANSITION TEMPORELLE :**
```
Exterior wide shot, same house and road from Scene 4, but THREE MONTHS LATER. Spring has arrived - snow has melted, revealing brown grass, muddy ground, water dripping everywhere. Sky is overcast but brighter than winter scenes. Trees have tiny green buds. The roadside ditch is visible now, full of muddy water. The drainage pipe entrance partially visible, dark and ominous. ANABELLE (noticeably pregnant now - 5 months, visible belly) walks slowly from house toward road, wearing light jacket. She looks for a letter blown into ditch by wind (we see white envelope stuck in mud). Reluctant but methodical movement. Camera wide, showing changed landscape - spring should mean rebirth but feels wrong, ominous. 2.35:1, 4K. Photorealistic. Color palette: muddy browns, dirty whites, grey sky, green buds (life returning uncomfortably). Style: "The Road" post-apocalyptic bleakness in normal setting. SOUND: Dripping water everywhere (constant), squelching mud, wind (still cold), no birds singing (unnatural silence).
```

**SYMBOLISME :**
- Printemps = Révélation
- Neige fondue = Secrets exposés
- Anabelle enceinte = Vie/mort juxtaposées

---

#### PLAN 13.2 : Approche du tuyau (15 secondes)

**PROMPT MONTÉE DE TENSION :**
```
Medium tracking shot following ANABELLE as she carefully descends muddy slope into ditch. Camera at her eye level, moving with her (steadicam). Her pregnant belly visible (she protects it with one hand). Muddy water ankle-deep, she struggles to keep balance. She reaches toward the envelope stuck in mud near pipe entrance. As she bends (slow motion 50%), she hears it: SOUND from inside pipe - faint scratching? Dripping? Ronronnement? She freezes. Looks at pipe entrance (dark hole). Camera pushes slowly toward it with her POV. Something visible in darkness? She reaches toward pipe instead of letter. Her hand trembling, extends into the dark opening. Fingers touch something. Close-up of her face: confusion → realization → horror (dawning slowly). She touches fabric? Fur? Hair? Her hand recoils. She looks at her fingers (mud, but also... something else). She grabs her phone (modern iPhone), turns on flashlight. 2.35:1, 4K. Photorealistic. Slow motion for key moments. Style: "Prisoners" discovering horror, "Gone Girl" revealing truth. SOUND: Her breathing loud and fast, water dripping, distant rumbling (memory of snowplow?), then... nothing. Silence before horror.
```

**DURÉE ÉTIRÉE :**
Chaque seconde semble durer éternité
Angoisse maximale avant révélation

---

#### PLAN 13.3 : LA DÉCOUVERTE (8 secondes)

**PROMPT POUR MOMENT LE PLUS INTENSE :**
```
Extreme close-up of ANABELLE's face, iPhone flashlight illuminating her from below (creates horror lighting - shadows upward). Her eyes widen impossibly large, pupils dilating, mouth opens slowly in a silent scream that builds. Camera very tight on her face, every pore visible, tear ducts activating, color draining from face (going white). We DON'T see what she sees (more terrifying). QUICK INSERT (0.5 seconds): Flash of child's face, pale, eyes open and clouded, partially preserved by cold, in red coat. BACK TO Anabelle's face: The scream finally comes out - PIERCING, raw, animal. It's the most terrible sound. She falls backward into mud, scrambling away from pipe on hands and knees, still screaming. Camera holds on her as she collapses in mud, screaming, clutching her pregnant belly, rocking. SOUND CUTS OUT COMPLETELY - silence (shell shock). Only image of her screaming with no sound, then slow fade to black. 2.35:1, 4K. Photorealistic horror. Style: "Hereditary" car scene aftermath, "Midsommar" ritual horror, "The Wailing" discovery of dead child. CRITICAL: We barely see the body - suggestion more horrifying than showing. Focus on mother's reaction.
```

**PRODUCTION NOTE :**
Le corps d'Eva est suggéré, pas montré graphiquement
L'horreur vient de la réaction d'Anabelle

**SON :**
- Cri d'Anabelle (à déchirer l'âme)
- Coupure brutale du son (traumatisme)
- Bourdonnement grave (acouphène psychologique)

---

## 🎬 ACTE IV - LA VÉRITÉ POURRIE (45-55 minutes)

---

### SCÈNE 14-15 : Le Corps + Explosion (Montage 40 secondes)

**PROMPT MONTAGE AFTERMATH :**
```
Quick documentary-style montage of aftermath. SHOT 1: Ambulance and police cars, lights flashing (no sirens, quiet horror). SHOT 2: Body bag on stretcher (small, child-sized, devastating) loaded into coroner's van. SHOT 3: Police tape around drainage pipe. SHOT 4: ANABELLE sitting on ambulance bumper, blanket around shoulders, catatonic (paramedic checking her). SHOT 5: SHAWN arriving, running, being held back by police. SHOT 6: Shawn sees the body bag, collapses. SHOT 7: Villagers gathering at distance, watching (like vultures). SHOT 8: News van arriving (media descends). SHOT 9: Close-up of Sergeant Beaulieu's face - guilt? Relief? Indifference? SHOT 10: Back to Anabelle - she's not crying, not moving, in shock. Each shot 3-4 seconds. Handheld, documentary realism. Desaturated colors almost black and white. 2.35:1, 4K. Style: "Zodiac" crime scene documentation, "Memories of Murder" police procedures. SOUND: radio chatter, camera shutters, murmured conversations, no music (respect the tragedy).
```

---

### SCÈNE 16 : Le Chat Reste - Le Vieil Homme

#### PLAN 16.1 : Le chat continue de rôder (12 secondes)

**PROMPT PERSISTANCE DU CHAT :**
```
Exterior dusk, Anabelle's house (post-discovery, 1 week later). The BLACK CAT sits on the porch railing, silhouetted against purple-orange sunset. It's cleaning its paw (normal cat behavior) but the context makes it eerie. Interior visible through window: Anabelle sitting motionless on couch, lights off. The cat stops, looks directly at window/her, then at camera (breaks fourth wall), holds gaze for 3 seconds. Slow zoom on cat's face - eyes reflect sunset (golden-orange). Unsettling intelligence in its expression. It jumps down from railing, walks away into gathering darkness. Camera holds on empty porch, then pans to window showing Anabelle still motionless inside. 2.35:1, 4K. Photorealistic cat, but perfect behavior/timing (too perfect). Style: "The Omen" animal as omen, "Pet Sematary" cat with knowledge. SOUND: Wind chimes (weren't there before), cat's soft padding, distant children playing (other children, not Eva - life goes on cruelly).
```

---

#### PLAN 16.2 : Le vieil homme parle (25 secondes)

**PROMPT EXPOSITION MYSTÉRIEUSE :**
```
Interior, Anabelle's living room, day. ANABELLE sits on couch, still catatonic, hasn't changed clothes in days. Doorbell rings. She doesn't respond. Knock. Door opens (unlocked - she doesn't care). ELDERLY MAN (80s, stooped, wearing old wool coat and hat, weathered Quebec farmer face, white beard) enters hesitantly. "Madame?" (gravelly voice). He sits uninvited on chair across from her. Long pause. He speaks slowly, accent thick: "Ce chat-là... il revient toujours." (That cat... it always comes back). Anabelle's eyes flick to him (first sign of life). "Quand un enfant meurt, mais pas tout à fait." (When a child dies, but not quite). Her brow furrows. "Qu'est-ce que vous voulez dire?" (What do you mean?). He looks at her with pity and fear. Long pause. "Rien. Oubliez." (Nothing. Forget.). He stands, leaves. She watches him go, confused and disturbed. Camera static, medium two-shot, then close on her face processing his cryptic words. 2.35:1, 4K. Photorealistic, naturalistic acting (non-professional old man aesthetic). Style: "The Wailing" cryptic elder warnings, "Twin Peaks" small town secrets. SOUND: Ticking clock (prominent), his labored breathing, her silence (absence of crying - beyond tears).
```

**AMBIGUÏTÉ MAINTENUE :**
- Que sait-il?
- Superstition ou vérité?
- "Pas tout à fait" = quoi?

---

## 🎬 ACTE V - LE FANTÔME INTÉRIEUR (55-60 minutes)

---

### SCÈNE 17 : L'Accouchement

#### PLAN 17.1 : Hôpital - Seule (30 secondes)

**PROMPT ACCOUCHEMENT SOLITAIRE :**
```
Interior hospital delivery room, harsh clinical lighting (white LED, 6500K). ANABELLE (9 months pregnant) lies in hospital bed, in labor, gripping sheets. She's ALONE - no Shawn, no family, just her and medical staff (faces obscured/background). Camera close on her face, sweaty, in pain, but also emotionally dead (going through motions). She breathes through contraction (Lamaze breathing), but eyes are elsewhere (thinking of Eva). Montage within scene: FLASH to Eva's face (memory), FLASH to tunnel (trauma), FLASH to body in pipe (horror), BACK TO delivery room. Doctor's voice off-screen: "Poussez!" (Push!). She pushes. Sound of baby crying starts. SMASH CUT to baby on her chest (traditional joyful moment). But her face: no joy. She looks at the baby (newborn, crying, alive) but her expression is hollow. She's broken. THEN: baby stops crying mid-cry. Silence. Baby purrs (like a cat). Close-up Anabelle's face: "What?" She looks down. Close-up baby's face: normal baby. Cries again (normal baby cry). Was the purring hallucination? Camera slowly zooms out showing her alone with newborn in clinical room. 2.35:1, 4K. Photorealistic hospital setting. Style: "Rosemary's Baby" horrifying birth, "Antichrist" traumatized mother. SOUND: medical beeps, her labor breathing, baby cry that becomes purr becomes cry (audio manipulation), her silence (no words spoken).
```

**AMBIGUÏTÉ FINALE :**
- Bébé est normal ou...?
- Anabelle folle ou...?
- Cycle continue?

---

### SCÈNE 18 : Retour du Silence

#### PLAN 18.1 : Berceuse (20 secondes)

**PROMPT SCÈNE PERTURBANTE :**
```
Interior, nursery (new apartment - Anabelle has moved), night. Soft nightlight (warm yellow glow). ANABELLE sits in rocking chair, holding baby (6 months old), rocking mechanically. She sings berceuse (lullaby) in French: "Dors, mon petit ange / La nuit est si longue / Dors, ne pleure pas / Maman est là..." (Sleep, my little angel / The night is so long / Sleep, don't cry / Mama is here...) But her voice is flat, emotionless, like a broken music box. Camera slowly circles around her (360°). As it circles, we see: on the wall, shadow of the BLACK CAT (though we don't see actual cat). The shadow moves independently (walks along wall). Back to Anabelle's face: she sees the shadow, doesn't react (accepted it). Baby in her arms: sleeping peacefully. Camera completes circle, now looking at her from front. Close-up of baby: VERY BRIEF (0.5 seconds) flash of cat's face instead of baby, then normal baby again. Was it there? Fade to black mid-lullaby (her voice continues over black screen then fades). 2.35:1, 4K. Photorealistic but dreamlike. Style: "The Babadook" sinister bedtime, "The Witch" domestic horror. SOUND: Lullaby (off-key, slowed slightly like dying battery), creaking rocking chair (rhythmic, hypnotic), purring (barely audible, under everything), her breath (mechanical).
```

**FINAL MESSAGE :**
Anabelle est "functional" mais brisée
Le chat/trauma est permanent
Cycle de folie maternelle

---

### SCÈNE 19 : ÉPILOGUE - Ça Recommence

#### PLAN 19.1 : Autre maison, autre enfant (30 secondes)

**PROMPT FINAL - CYCLE INFERNAL :**
```
Exterior night, DIFFERENT HOUSE in DIFFERENT VILLAGE (similar aesthetic - rural Quebec). Establishing shot (similar to Scene 2). Inside visible through window: DIFFERENT MOTHER (30s, different actress but similar tired working mother vibe) at kitchen table, working on laptop. Upstairs window: DIFFERENT CHILD (8-10 years old, could be boy or girl, silhouette) playing in room. Camera slowly pushes toward house. SOUND: scratching at front door (same sound from Scenes 3, 8). Interior visible: child hears it, gets up, goes to stairs. Mother doesn't notice (headphones on). Camera on front door (exterior POV): door opens. BLACK CAT sits on doorstep, staring. Child appears in doorway, looks down at cat. Cat turns, walks into darkness. Child, in pajamas, steps out after it. Door closes behind child. Camera wide: child follows cat into snowy yard (winter again - cycle repeating exactly). SLOW ZOOM OUT: pulling back, pulling back, showing house getting smaller, child's small figure disappearing into white landscape. TEXT ON SCREEN: "Basé sur des faits oubliés" (Based on forgotten events). FINAL IMAGE: just white snow, darkness, and wind sound. Hold for 5 seconds. Cut to black. End credits. 2.35:1, 4K. Photorealistic. Perfect visual echo of opening/Eva's disappearance (audience recognition). Style: "It Follows" curse passing on, "The Ring" cycle repeating, "Funny Games" fourth wall nihilism. SOUND: Same scratching, same cat meow, same wind, same silence... exactly like before. Circular horror.
