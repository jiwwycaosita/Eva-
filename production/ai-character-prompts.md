#### DESCRIPTION PHYSIQUE COMPLÈTE

**PROMPT POUR GÉNÉRATION CONSISTANTE :**
```
Woman, 32 years old, Caucasian, French-Canadian features. Medium height (5'6"/168cm), slim build becoming thinner throughout film (weight loss from stress). Dark brown hair (shoulder-length, natural straight texture, often tied in messy low bun or ponytail, strands falling out). Hazel-green eyes, almond-shaped, intelligent but haunted expression. Pale skin (naturally fair, becomes paler from lack of sunlight/sleep). Dark circles under eyes (progressive - start subtle, become pronounced purple-grey). Face shape: oval, defined cheekbones, slightly pointed chin. Nose: straight, medium size. Lips: full, natural pink, often chapped (winter, neglect). No makeup or minimal (concealer, she's too depressed to care). Visible tiredness: fine lines around eyes, between eyebrows (stress). Natural freckles on nose/cheeks (faint). Realistic skin texture with pores visible in close-ups.

Body language: Shoulders often hunched, protective posture. Hands frequently fidgeting (anxiety). Movements: initially purposeful but becoming increasingly erratic, then lethargic. Gait: normal walk becomes shuffling (depression). 

Photorealistic, film quality, 4K detail. Reference actresses: Toni Collette (Hereditary), Essie Davis (The Babadook), Vera Farmiga for facial structure.

```
Clothing: Oversized grey knit sweater (loose, comfortable, worn), dark blue jeans (casual fit), no jewelry except small silver stud earrings, grey wool socks (at home). Hair: tied back messily but somewhat maintained. Overall: "casual depressed mom" aesthetic - comfortable clothes, low effort but not completely neglected.
```

**ACTE II - Après disparition (Recherches)**
```
Clothing: Red winter parka (bright red, puffy down coat - stands out in searches, practical), black fleece under, dark jeans, black winter boots, no hat (too frantic).

Overall: complete neglect of appearance, psychological breakdown visible in physical decay.
```

```
Clothing: Oversized black hoodie (comfort/hiding), leggings, old t-shirt. Pregnant belly starting to show (5-6 months). Hair: hasn't been washed in week+, possibly cut shorter herself (unevenly). Face: catatonic expression, no light in eyes. Overall: zombie-like, going through motions, no self-care.
```

**ACTE V - Post-accouchement**
```
Clothing: Simple nursing-friendly clothes (loose top, cardigan), maternity leggings. Hair: maybe washed but still limp, lifeless. Face: slight improvement physically but emotionally dead. Overall: functional depression - can care for baby but internally broken.

### LE CHAT NOIR (Entité/Personnage)

**DESCRIPTION DÉTAILLÉE :**

**PROMPT POUR GÉNÉRATION CONSISTANTE DU CHAT :**
```
Black cat, large size (Maine Coon or similar long-haired breed), adult male. Completely jet-black fur (long, slightly unkempt, individual hairs visible in close-ups), no white markings anywhere. Yellow-green eyes (bright, reflective, large, intense gaze, slit pupils that dilate/contract). Pink nose and paw pads (visible in extreme close-ups). Muscular build under fur, long tail (bushy). Ears pointed, alert.

Behavior: UNNATURALLY STILL - sits without moving for long periods, doesn't fidget like real cats. Stares directly at characters (or camera) without blinking for too long. Movements when it does move: fluid, deliberate, graceful but purposeful. Never shows typical cat behaviors (playing, grooming) except when trying to seem "normal." Appears in impossible places (how did it get there?).

Eyes CRITICAL: Reflective in darkness (tapetum lucidum), glow slightly (natural cat eye-shine but emphasized for effect). Seems to know things - intelligence in gaze beyond normal cat. Blinks slowly (predator, confident).

Photorealistic cat BUT perfect behavior/timing/placement (just slightly off from normal cat, uncanny valley). Can appear threatening or innocent depending on context/lighting.

SOUND: Purring (lower frequency than normal, almost growl), meowing (sounds slightly wrong, echo?), movements silent (doesn't knock things over like real cats).

This cat is THE symbol of the film. Must be consistent, recognizable, unsettling while being a real animal.
```

**PROMPT POUR VARIATIONS DU CHAT :**

**Chat "Normal" (Début)**
```
Black cat sitting calmly, looking cute/innocent, normal cat behavior, grooming, soft lighting. Seems harmless.
```

**Chat "Inquiétant" (Milieu)**
```
Black cat in shadows, eyes reflecting light (green glow), sitting absolutely still, staring unblinking, ominous lighting (backlit, silhouette).
```

**Chat "Surnaturel" (Moments Clés)**
```
Black cat appearing in impossible locations, eyes glowing brighter than natural, slight motion blur (moves faster than eye can track?), appears/disappears between frames (implication: was it ever there?).
```

## 🎨 NOTES DE CONSISTANCE POUR L'IA

### PROBLÈMES COMMUNS ET SOLUTIONS

**Problème 1 : Visages changent entre générations**
```
SOLUTION: Utiliser MÊME prompt exact avec seed/reference image pour chaque scène. Créer "character sheet" avec 5-6 angles du même personnage (front, profile, 3/4, etc.) puis utiliser comme référence pour autres générations.
```

**Problème 2 : Costumes varient**
```
SOLUTION: Décrire vêtements en détail extrême, couleurs exactes (hex codes si possible), marques/style. Générer "costume sheet" séparément.
```

**Problème 3 : Éclairage sur visage change personnage**
```
SOLUTION: Spécifier éclairage dans prompt personnage en plus de prompt scène. Ex: "même personnage sous éclairage X."
```

**Problème 4 : Personnages semblent trop "modèles"**
```
SOLUTION: Ajouter "realistic imperfections, not model-like, everyday person, visible pores and skin texture, asymmetrical features" dans tous prompts.
```
